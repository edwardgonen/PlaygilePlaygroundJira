1. Installed Jira 8.5.5
2. Set JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_172
3. Add to Path %JAVA_HOME%\bin
4. Download Atlassian Plugin SDK for Windows
5. Install Plugin SDK
6. SDK is installed at C:\Applications\Atlassian\atlassian-plugin-sdk-8.0.16
7. Add C:\Applications\Atlassian\atlassian-plugin-sdk-8.0.16\bin to Path
8. Create folder for project c:\projects\PlaygilePlayground\PlaygilePlaygroundJira
9. Run atlas-create-jira-plugin in the said folder
10. During creation specifty "com.playgileplayground.jira" in groupId and "playgilePlugin" in artefactID. leave version as it is
		Confirm properties configuration:
		groupId: com.playgileplayground.jira
		artifactId: playgilePlugin
		version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
		package: com.playgileplayground.jira
11. Press Enter to confirm
12. Add or push to remote repository
13. Run (not sure why it is needed, probably just run unittests)
		$ cd playgilePlugin
		$ atlas-integration-test 
14. Seems that Atlassian SDK installation override the JAVA_HOME. to JAVA_HOME=C:\Applications\Atlassian\atlassian-plugin-sdk-8.0.16\jre
15. I'm replacing that with my original JAVA_HOME C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_172
16. Run atlas-run -o (the -o switch prevents the download maven all the times)
17. To package run atlas-package which creates ....jar file
18. Import it to Jira via Manage Apps, select the JAR file and it is here!



Now I'm working on creating a servlet according to tutorial.

I can access it http://localhost:2990/jira/plugins/servlet/projectmonitor

================================ Project preparation algorithm ----------------------------------

1. Get list of roadmap features that not Cancelled and not Go-Live not Closed not done not Resolved (project="PK Features" AND issuetype="Roadmap Feature" and issueLinkType="Is Parent task of:" AND Status!=Done AND Status!=Resolved)
2. for each RF:
   1. Get query issuefunction in linkedIssuesOf('id=PKP-85')
      This will give a list of product-related linked issues. Monetization(PKM), BI(BIT), BA(PKBA), Economics (PKEC) tasks - those names should appear in the Key of issue
      i.e. substring("PKM") or something. I'll build array of PKM, PKBA, PKEC, BIT. Each element may contain a list of tasks. For example
      there may be 2 or 3 links that have PKM in the name. I'll group them together.

      Roadmap Feature New Tutorial
               PKM
                  ---- PKM task 1
                  ---- PKM task 2
               PKBA
                  ---- PKBA task1
               BIT
                  ---- BIT task1
                  ---- BIT taks2
               PKEC
                  ---- PKEC task3

   2. Each task above should contain start date (we use creation date if missing) and Due Date. If no due date - mark that task on the gantt as "invalid"
   3. We draw
         Monetization
                       startdate task1 ------------------ due date task1
                                startdate task2 --------------- due date task2
         Economics
                            startdate task1 ------------------ due date task1
         BI
                                            startdate task1 ------------------ due date task1
                          startdate task2 --------------- due date task2
         BA
                                                        startdate task3 ------------------ due date task3

   4. No percentage done in the tasks
   5. Progress indication colors
    1. if less than 10% of task duration from today to the due date we show the task yellow
    2. If today is beyond the due date shoe the task red
    3. Otherwise show it green


   6. In Web page 3 levels. The roadmap feature contains Business Approval Date. By this date we group the Roadmap features on the screen
      August
        +RF1 (general info about feature including color-coded status)
        +RF2
                    BI         ===========
                    Economy        ------------
                    BA                  -------------
      September
        +RF2
        +RF3
      October
      Not yet planned features (here I group all those without Business approval date)

 ========================================== Roadmap features analysis algorithm =====================================
      1. There are following configuration parameters to the algorithm that are stored in Jira DB (Active Objects) per each RF
         Default SP Value for non-estimated (<= 0) stories and tasks
         Sprint length
         RF Start date
         Default initial velocity

      2. The list of all RFs for a project is achieved via the following query
              String searchString = "project = \"" + currentProject.getName() + "\" and issuetype = \"" + featureKey + "\"
                            and status != Cancelled and status != Go-Live and status != \"On Hold\"";
              the featureKey = "Roadmap Feature";

      3. If no Roadmap features found by the query above - a message will be given to the user and no list will be presented.

         The query for issues in RF is done as below:
           if (Jira version > 7.x ) && //for production jira versin is > 7. Needed for backward compatibility
               It is not Board King project //temporary limitation because of something with BK project
               then
                    query = "issueFunction in linkedIssuesOf(\"issueKey=" + roadmapFeature.getKey() + "\",\"Is Parent task of:\")";
           else //old form for dev jira environment and BK
                    searchString = "issue in linkedIssues(\""  + roadmapFeature.getKey() +  "\")";

        If the number of found issues from the query above is 0 the Roadmap Feature is considered wrongly defined. It will not appear
        in our lists and thus won't be available. An appropriate log will be written, though no message will be given

      4. If the selected RF is well-configured (i.e. at least one issue exists) we will do the following:
         4.1 Determine if the RF has started:
             if (RF Start date exists in Configuration and it is <= Current date) the RF start date is set to that value and project is considered started
             else if there is at least one closed or active sprint the RF start date is set to that first (oldest) sprint start date
             ??? Not now - else since we have at least one issue in backlog the RF start date will be set to the creation date of the oldest issue
             *** one of the conditions above true will result in RF considered as Started
             else the RF is considered not started. Such RF will not appear in the list

         4.2 The Sprint length is determined as follow:
             If defined in configuration (i.e. > 0) then Sprint length = configured
             else Sprint length = (End of oldest sprint - Start of oldest sprint)
             else Sprint length = 14 (hardcoded default). If sprint lengths is less 1-7 days the lengths is set to 7
             In any case the sprint length is rounded to 7 days. I.e. for value of 4 it will be 7, for 9 it will be 14 etc.
         4.3 Default SP Value for non-estimated (<= 0) stories and tasks:
             If configured will be used as default estimation for non estimated issues
             else a hard-coded value of 13 will be used
         4.4 Default initial velocity:
             It will be used for the RF completion prediction when there is not enough information to calculate real velocity (i.e. 2 or less closed sprints)
             If not configured - a hard-coded value of 50 will be used

      5. Once all those values from above are calculated we do:
         5.1 Go from the RF start date till today with a step of "Sprint length - 1" (if sprint starts on Tuesday, it will end on Monday i.e. -1 day)
             5.1.1 Calculate all stories closed within that period. Story is considered closed within this period if is in the "Done" status
                   and the Resolution date is within that period (>= start <= end of sprint)
             5.1.2 Calculate the sum of estimations for all not Done user stories in the list
             5.1.3 Calculate predictions of RF completion based on configured velocity and real velocity (both are presented on the chart)
             5.1.4 Calculate current distribution of not done issues by their estimation values - very large, large, medium, normal
         5.2 After we finished with all "sprints" calculate issues closure average distribution across the sprints
         5.3 Serialize everything for Web
